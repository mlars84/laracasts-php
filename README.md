### PHP array
  - `$cars = array("Volvo","BMW","Toyota");`

### Constants
  - To create a constant, use the define() function.
  - A valid constant name starts with a letter or underscore (no $ sign before the constant name).
  - `define("GREETING", "Welcome to W3Schools.com!");`
  - Constants are automatically global and can be used across the entire script.

### [PHP Operators](https://www.w3schools.com/php/php_operators.asp)
  Arithmetic operators
  Assignment operators
  Comparison operators
  Increment/Decrement operators
  Logical operators
  String operators

  ### If/Else exactly like JS
  ```
  if (condition) {
    code to be executed if condition is true;
  } else {
    code to be executed if condition is false;
  }
  ```
